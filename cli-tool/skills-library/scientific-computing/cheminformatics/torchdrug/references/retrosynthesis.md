## Task Types

TorchDrug decomposes retrosynthesis into a multi-step pipeline:

### 1. CenterIdentification

Identifies the reaction center - which bonds were formed/broken in the forward reaction.

**Input:** Product molecule
**Output:** Probability for each bond of being part of reaction center

**Purpose:**
- Locate where chemistry happened
- Guide subsequent synthon generation
- Reduce search space dramatically

**Model Architecture:**
- Graph neural network on product molecule
- Edge-level classification
- Attention mechanisms to highlight reactive regions

**Evaluation Metrics:**
- **Top-K Accuracy**: Correct reaction center in top K predictions
- **Bond-level F1**: Precision and recall for bond predictions

### 2. SynthonCompletion

Given the product and identified reaction center, predict the reactant structures (synthons).

**Input:**
- Product molecule
- Identified reaction center (broken/formed bonds)

**Output:**
- Predicted reactant molecules (synthons)

**Process:**
1. Break bonds at reaction center
2. Modify atom environments (valence, charges)
3. Determine leaving groups and protecting groups
4. Generate complete reactant structures

**Challenges:**
- Multiple valid reactant sets
- Stereospecificity
- Atom environment changes (hybridization, charge)
- Leaving group selection

**Evaluation:**
- **Exact Match**: Generated reactants exactly match ground truth
- **Top-K Accuracy**: Correct reactants in top K predictions
- **Chemical Validity**: Generated molecules are valid

### 3. Retrosynthesis (End-to-End)

Combines center identification and synthon completion into a unified pipeline.

**Input:** Target product molecule
**Output:** Ranked list of reactant sets (synthesis pathways)

**Workflow:**
1. Identify top-K reaction centers
2. For each center, generate reactant candidates
3. Rank combinations by model confidence
4. Filter for commercial availability and feasibility

**Advantages:**
- Single model to train and deploy
- Joint optimization of subtasks
- Error propagation from center identification accounted for

## Training Workflows

### Basic Pipeline

```python
from torchdrug import datasets, models, tasks

# Load dataset
dataset = datasets.USPTO50k("~/retro-datasets/")

# For center identification
model_center = models.RGCN(
    input_dim=dataset.node_feature_dim,
    num_relation=dataset.num_bond_type,
    hidden_dims=[256, 256, 256]
)

task_center = tasks.CenterIdentification(
    model_center,
    top_k=3  # Consider top 3 reaction centers
)

# For synthon completion
model_synthon = models.GIN(
    input_dim=dataset.node_feature_dim,
    hidden_dims=[256, 256, 256]
)

task_synthon = tasks.SynthonCompletion(
    model_synthon,
    center_topk=3,  # Use top 3 from center identification
    num_synthon_beam=5  # Beam search for synthon generation
)

# End-to-end
task_retro = tasks.Retrosynthesis(
    model=model_center,
    synthon_model=model_synthon,
    center_topk=5,
    num_synthon_beam=10
)
```

- Guided by model confidence
- State-of-the-art for multi-step planning

**A\* Search:**
- Heuristic-guided search
- Optimizes for cost, complexity, or feasibility
- Efficient for finding best routes

### Route Scoring

Rank synthetic routes by:
1. **Number of Steps**: Fewer is better (efficiency)
2. **Convergent vs Linear**: Convergent routes preferred
3. **Commercial Availability**: How many steps to buyable compounds
4. **Reaction Feasibility**: Likelihood each step works
5. **Overall Yield**: Estimated end-to-end yield
6. **Cost**: Reagents, labor, equipment
7. **Green Chemistry**: Environmental impact, safety

### Stopping Criteria

Stop retrosynthesis when reaching:
- **Commercial Compounds**: Available from vendors (e.g., Sigma-Aldrich, Enamine)
- **Building Blocks**: Standard synthetic intermediates
- **Max Depth**: e.g., 6-10 steps
