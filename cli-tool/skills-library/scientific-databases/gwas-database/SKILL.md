# GWAS Catalog Database

## Overview

The GWAS Catalog is a comprehensive repository of published genome-wide association studies maintained by the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI) and the European Bioinformatics Institute (EBI). The catalog contains curated SNP-trait associations from thousands of GWAS publications, including genetic variants, associated traits and diseases, p-values, effect sizes, and full summary statistics for many studies.

## When to Use This Skill

This skill should be used when queries involve:

- **Genetic variant associations**: Finding SNPs associated with diseases or traits
- **SNP lookups**: Retrieving information about specific genetic variants (rs IDs)
- **Trait/disease searches**: Discovering genetic associations for phenotypes
- **Gene associations**: Finding variants in or near specific genes
- **GWAS summary statistics**: Accessing complete genome-wide association data
- **Study metadata**: Retrieving publication and cohort information
- **Population genetics**: Exploring ancestry-specific associations
- **Polygenic risk scores**: Identifying variants for risk prediction models
- **Functional genomics**: Understanding variant effects and genomic context
- **Systematic reviews**: Comprehensive literature synthesis of genetic associations

## Core Capabilities

### 1. Understanding GWAS Catalog Data Structure

The GWAS Catalog is organized around four core entities:

- **Studies**: GWAS publications with metadata (PMID, author, cohort details)
- **Associations**: SNP-trait associations with statistical evidence (p ≤ 5×10⁻⁸)
- **Variants**: Genetic markers (SNPs) with genomic coordinates and alleles
- **Traits**: Phenotypes and diseases (mapped to EFO ontology terms)

**Key Identifiers:**
- Study accessions: `GCST` IDs (e.g., GCST001234)
- Variant IDs: `rs` numbers (e.g., rs7903146) or `variant_id` format
- Trait IDs: EFO terms (e.g., EFO_0001360 for type 2 diabetes)
- Gene symbols: HGNC approved names (e.g., TCF7L2)

### 2. Web Interface Searches

The web interface at https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gwas/ supports multiple search modes:

**By Variant (rs ID):**
```
rs7903146
```
Returns all trait associations for this SNP.

**By Disease/Trait:**
```
type 2 diabetes
Parkinson disease
body mass index
```
Returns all associated genetic variants.

**By Gene:**
```
APOE
TCF7L2
```
Returns variants in or near the gene region.

**By Chromosomal Region:**
```
10:114000000-115000000
```
Returns variants in the specified genomic interval.

**By Publication:**
```
PMID:20581827
Author: McCarthy MI
GCST001234
```
Returns study details and all reported associations.

### 3. REST API Access

### 4. Query Examples and Patterns

**Example 1: Find all associations for a disease**
```python
import requests

trait = "EFO_0001360"  # Type 2 diabetes
base_url = "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gwas/rest/api"

# Query associations for this trait
url = f"{base_url}/efoTraits/{trait}/associations"
response = requests.get(url, headers={"Content-Type": "application/json"})
associations = response.json()

# Process results
for assoc in associations.get('_embedded', {}).get('associations', []):
    variant = assoc.get('rsId')
    pvalue = assoc.get('pvalue')
    risk_allele = assoc.get('strongestAllele')
    print(f"{variant}: p={pvalue}, risk allele={risk_allele}")
```

**Example 2: Get variant information and all trait associations**
```python
import requests

variant = "rs7903146"
base_url = "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gwas/rest/api"

# Get variant details
url = f"{base_url}/singleNucleotidePolymorphisms/{variant}"
response = requests.get(url, headers={"Content-Type": "application/json"})
variant_data = response.json()

# Get all associations for this variant
url = f"{base_url}/singleNucleotidePolymorphisms/{variant}/associations"
params = {"projection": "associationBySnp"}
response = requests.get(url, params=params, headers={"Content-Type": "application/json"})
associations = response.json()

# Extract trait names and p-values
for assoc in associations.get('_embedded', {}).get('associations', []):
    trait = assoc.get('efoTrait')
    pvalue = assoc.get('pvalue')
    print(f"Trait: {trait}, p-value: {pvalue}")
```

**Example 3: Access summary statistics**
```python
import requests

# Query summary statistics API
base_url = "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gwas/summary-statistics/api"

# Find associations by trait with p-value threshold
trait = "EFO_0001360"  # Type 2 diabetes
p_upper = "0.000000001"  # p < 1e-9
url = f"{base_url}/traits/{trait}/associations"
params = {
    "p_upper": p_upper,
    "size": 100  # Number of results
}
response = requests.get(url, params=params)
results = response.json()

# Process genome-wide significant hits
for hit in results.get('_embedded', {}).get('associations', []):
    variant_id = hit.get('variant_id')
    chromosome = hit.get('chromosome')
    position = hit.get('base_pair_location')
    pvalue = hit.get('p_value')
    print(f"{chromosome}:{position} ({variant_id}): p={pvalue}")
```

**Example 4: Query by chromosomal region**
```python
import requests

# Find variants in a specific genomic region
chromosome = "10"
start_pos = 114000000
end_pos = 115000000

base_url = "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gwas/rest/api"
url = f"{base_url}/singleNucleotidePolymorphisms/search/findByChromBpLocationRange"
params = {
    "chrom": chromosome,
    "bpStart": start_pos,
    "bpEnd": end_pos
}
response = requests.get(url, params=params, headers={"Content-Type": "application/json"})
variants_in_region = response.json()
```

### 5. Working with Summary Statistics

The GWAS Catalog hosts full summary statistics for many studies, providing access to all tested variants (not just genome-wide significant hits).

**Access Methods:**
1. **FTP download**: http://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/gwas/summary_statistics/
2. **REST API**: Query-based access to summary statistics
3. **Web interface**: Browse and download via the website

**Summary Statistics API Features:**
- Filter by chromosome, position, p-value
- Query specific variants across studies
- Retrieve effect sizes and allele frequencies
- Access harmonized and standardized data

**Example: Download summary statistics for a study**
```python
import requests
import gzip

# Get available summary statistics
base_url = "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gwas/summary-statistics/api"
url = f"{base_url}/studies/GCST001234"
response = requests.get(url)
study_info = response.json()

# Download link is provided in the response
# Alternatively, use FTP:
# ftp://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/gwas/summary_statistics/GCSTXXXXXX/
```

### 6. Data Integration and Cross-referencing

   - Browse summary statistics portal
   - Check FTP directory listings
   - Query API for available studies

2. **Download summary statistics:**
   ```bash
   # Via FTP
   wget ftp://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/gwas/summary_statistics/GCSTXXXXXX/harmonised/GCSTXXXXXX-harmonised.tsv.gz
   ```

3. **Query via API for specific variants:**
   ```python
   url = f"https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gwas/summary-statistics/api/chromosomes/{chrom}/associations"
   params = {"start": start_pos, "end": end_pos}
   ```

4. **Process and analyze:**
   - Filter by p-value thresholds
   - Extract effect sizes and confidence intervals
   - Perform downstream analyses (fine-mapping, colocalization, etc.)

## Response Formats and Data Fields

**Key Fields in Association Records:**
- `rsId`: Variant identifier (rs number)
- `strongestAllele`: Risk allele for the association
- `pvalue`: Association p-value
- `pvalueText`: P-value as text (may include inequality)
- `orPerCopyNum`: Odds ratio or beta coefficient
- `betaNum`: Effect size (for quantitative traits)

## Best Practices

### Query Strategy
- Start with web interface to identify relevant EFO terms and study accessions
- Use API for bulk data extraction and automated analyses
- Implement pagination handling for large result sets
- Cache API responses to minimize redundant requests

### Data Interpretation
- Always check p-value thresholds (genome-wide: 5×10⁻⁸)
- Review ancestry information for population applicability
- Consider sample size when assessing evidence strength
- Check for replication across independent studies
- Be aware of winner's curse in effect size estimates

### Rate Limiting and Ethics
- Respect API usage guidelines (no excessive requests)
- Use summary statistics downloads for genome-wide analyses
- Implement appropriate delays between API calls
- Cache results locally when performing iterative analyses
- Cite the GWAS Catalog in publications

### Data Quality Considerations
- GWAS Catalog curates published associations (may contain inconsistencies)
- Effect sizes reported as published (may need harmonization)
- Some studies report conditional or joint associations
- Check for study overlap when combining results
- Be aware of ascertainment and selection biases

        page += 1
        sleep(0.1)  # Rate limiting

    return pd.DataFrame(results)

# Example usage
df = query_gwas_catalog('EFO_0001360')  # Type 2 diabetes
print(df.head())
print(f"\nTotal associations: {len(df)}")
print(f"Unique variants: {df['variant'].nunique()}")
