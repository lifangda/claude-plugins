# Complete Guide to Creating Claude Code Agents

This guide teaches you how to create specialized agents (subagents) for Claude Code using `.md` files with YAML frontmatter configuration.

## What are Claude Code Agents?

Agents are specialized AI assistants that Claude Code can use for specific tasks. Each agent:

- **Has a specific purpose** and area of expertise
- **Uses its own context** separate from the main conversation
- **Can be configured with specific tools** it's allowed to use
- **Includes a custom system prompt** that guides its behavior

## Key Benefits

### üîÑ Context Preservation
Each agent operates in its own context, avoiding contamination of the main conversation.

### üß† Specialized Expertise
Agents can be fine-tuned with detailed instructions for specific domains.

### ‚ôªÔ∏è Reusability
Once created, they can be used across different projects and shared with the team.

### üõ°Ô∏è Flexible Permissions
Each agent can have different levels of access to tools.

## File Locations

| Type | Location | Scope | Priority |
|------|----------|-------|----------|
| **Project Agents** | `.claude/agents/` | Available in current project | Higher |
| **User Agents** | `~/.claude/agents/` | Available across all projects | Lower |

*When there are name conflicts, project agents take precedence.*

## File Format

Each agent is defined in a Markdown file with this structure:

```markdown
---
name: agent-name
description: Description of when this agent should be invoked
tools: tool1, tool2, tool3  # Optional
model: sonnet  # Optional: sonnet, opus, haiku
---

Your agent's system prompt goes here. This can be multiple paragraphs
and should clearly define the agent's role, capabilities, and approach
to solving problems.

Include specific instructions, best practices, and any constraints
the agent should follow.
```

## Configuration Fields

### `name` Field (Required)
- **Format**: Lowercase letters and hyphens only
- **Examples**: `code-reviewer`, `security-auditor`, `test-runner`
- **Purpose**: Unique identifier for the agent

### Integration Tests
- Module interactions
- API endpoints
- Database operations
- User workflows

### E2E Tests
- Complete user flows
- Cross-browser testing
- Performance under load
- Regression testing

## Testing Strategy

### Testing Pyramid
```
       üî∫ E2E Tests (Few, slow)
      üî∫üî∫ Integration Tests (Some)
   üî∫üî∫üî∫ Unit Tests (Many, fast)
```

### Automated Process
1. **Detect code changes**
   ```bash
   git diff --name-only HEAD~1
   ```

2. **Run relevant tests**
   ```bash
   npm test -- --testPathPattern="related"
   ```

3. **Analyze failures**
   - Stack traces
   - Error logs
   - Expected vs actual state

4. **Auto-fix**
   - Mock updates
   - Assertion adjustments
   - Test data corrections

## Testing Conventions

### Test Structure
```javascript
describe('ComponentName', () => {
  describe('when condition', () => {
    it('should behavior expectation', () => {
      // Arrange
      // Act  
      // Assert
    });
  });
});
```

### Descriptive Names
- ‚úÖ `should return user data when valid ID provided`
- ‚ùå `test user function`

### Clear Assertions
```javascript
// ‚úÖ Specific
expect(response.status).toBe(200);
expect(response.data.user.name).toBe('John Doe');

// ‚ùå Generic
expect(response).toBeTruthy();
```

## Failure Analysis

For each failing test:
1. **Identify root cause**
2. **Reproduce failure locally**
3. **Fix code or test**
4. **Verify solution is robust**

## Testing Report

```
üß™ TESTING REPORT

## Current Coverage
- Lines: X% (target: 80%)
- Branches: X% (target: 70%)
- Functions: X% (target: 85%)

## Tests Executed
- ‚úÖ Passed: X
- ‚ùå Failed: X
- ‚è≠Ô∏è  Skipped: X

## Failed Tests

```

## Best Practices for Creating Agents

### 1. Focused Design
- **One clear responsibility** per agent
- **Avoid generic agents** that try to do everything
- **Define clear boundaries** of what the agent should/shouldn't do

### 2. Detailed System Prompts
```markdown
## Recommended Structure

### Identification
"You are a [specific role] specializing in [area]."

### Work Process
1. Specific step with command or action
2. Clear evaluation criteria
3. Expected output format

### Standards and Metrics
- Objective metrics when possible
- Specific quality criteria
- Industry benchmarks

### Response Format
Consistent template with clear sections
```

### 3. Tool Limitation
```yaml
# ‚úÖ Specific to purpose
tools: Read, Grep, Bash

# ‚ùå Too broad
tools: Read, Edit, Write, Bash, Grep, Glob, WebFetch, WebSearch
```

### 4. Effective Descriptions
```yaml
# ‚úÖ Specific and actionable
description: "Code security auditor. Use PROACTIVELY for security reviews, auth implementations, and OWASP compliance checks."

# ‚ùå Too generic
description: "Helps with code stuff."
```

### 5. Agent Testing
- **Test with real cases** from your project
- **Verify it follows instructions** consistently
- **Adjust prompt based** on results
- **Document edge cases** it handles well

## Useful Commands for Management

### Create Project Agent
```bash
mkdir -p .claude/agents
```

### Create User Agent
```bash
mkdir -p ~/.claude/agents
```

### Validate YAML Format
```bash
# Verify frontmatter syntax
head -20 .claude/agents/your-agent.md
```

### Agent Testing
```bash
# In Claude Code, use slash command
/agents
```

## Advanced Use Cases

### 1. Agent Chaining
```
> First use code-reviewer to find issues, then use security-auditor to verify vulnerabilities
```

### 2. Contextual Agents
The correct agent is automatically selected based on:
- Task description
- Current project context
- Required tools

### 3. Specialized Workflow
```markdown
---
name: deployment-orchestrator
description: Manages complete deployment pipeline. Use when deploying to production or staging environments.
tools: Bash, Read, Write
---

Orchestrates deployment with these steps:
1. Pre-deployment checks
2. Build process
3. Testing validation  
4. Environment deployment
5. Post-deployment verification
6. Rollback procedures if needed
```

## Common Troubleshooting

### Issue: Agent doesn't invoke automatically
**Solution**: 
- Improve `description` with specific keywords
- Add "Use PROACTIVELY" in description
- Ensure filename matches `name` field

### Issue: Agent doesn't have tool access
**Solution**:
- Verify tools are listed correctly in `tools`
- Or omit `tools` field to inherit all tools

### Issue: System prompt too generic
**Solution**:
- Add specific examples of expected input/output
- Define objective success metrics
- Include specific commands it should execute

### Issue: Conflicts between agents
**Solution**:
- Use unique, descriptive names
- Project agents (.claude/agents/) have priority
- Remove duplicate or obsolete agents

## Conclusion

Claude Code agents are a powerful tool for automating and specializing your development workflow. With this guide, you can create effective agents that:

- **Automate repetitive tasks**
- **Maintain consistent standards**
- **Provide specialized expertise**
- **Improve team productivity**

Start with simple, specific agents, then build more complex workflows as you become familiar with the system.
