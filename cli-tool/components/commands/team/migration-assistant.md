# Migration Assistant

Execute comprehensive system migrations with planning, verification, and rollback capabilities: **$ARGUMENTS**

## Current Migration Context

- Source systems: GitHub CLI authentication and API access status
- Target systems: Linear MCP server connectivity and permissions
- Backup storage: Available storage space and backup verification
- Migration scope: Data volume estimation and complexity assessment

## Task

Execute systematic migration process with comprehensive safety measures and validation:

**Migration Action**: Use $ARGUMENTS to specify migration planning, analysis, execution, verification, or rollback operations

**Migration Framework**:
1. **Prerequisites Validation** - Verify GitHub CLI authentication, confirm Linear MCP connectivity, validate permissions, ensure backup storage
2. **Migration Planning** - Assess data volume and complexity, design migration strategy, identify dependencies, create rollback plan
3. **Risk Analysis** - Evaluate potential failure points, assess data integrity risks, identify system dependencies, plan contingency measures
4. **Execution Management** - Implement migration phases, monitor progress and health, handle errors gracefully, maintain audit trails
5. **Verification Process** - Validate data integrity, confirm system functionality, test user workflows, verify performance metrics
6. **Rollback Procedures** - Implement safe rollback mechanisms, restore system state, validate recovery, communicate status updates

**Advanced Features**: Incremental migration support, real-time progress monitoring, automated health checks, comprehensive logging, emergency stop mechanisms.

**Safety Measures**: Multi-point backups, integrity validation, rollback testing, system health monitoring, stakeholder communication.

**Output**: Complete migration execution with progress tracking, validation reports, rollback readiness, and post-migration optimization recommendations.
