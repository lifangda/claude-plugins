# Game Analytics & Player Intelligence System

Implement comprehensive game analytics and player intelligence: $ARGUMENTS

## Current Analytics Context

- Game platform: @package.json or detect Unity/Unreal/Godot project files
- Existing analytics: !`grep -r "Analytics\|Telemetry\|Tracking" . 2>/dev/null | wc -l` current implementations
- Data storage: @database/ or detect database configurations
- Privacy compliance: @privacy-policy.md or @GDPR/ (if exists)
- Platform SDKs: !`find . -name "*SDK*" -o -name "*Analytics*" | head -5`

## Task

Create a comprehensive analytics system for game development with player behavior tracking, performance monitoring, A/B testing capabilities, and business intelligence integration.

## Analytics Framework Components

### 1. Player Behavior Analytics
- Session tracking and engagement metrics
- User journey mapping and funnel analysis
- Feature usage and interaction heatmaps
- Player progression and achievement tracking
- Social interactions and community engagement metrics

### 2. Performance & Technical Analytics
- Frame rate and performance monitoring across devices
- Crash reporting and error tracking
- Loading times and optimization opportunities
- Memory usage patterns and optimization insights
- Network performance and connectivity analytics

### 3. Business Intelligence Integration
- Revenue tracking and monetization analytics
- User acquisition and retention metrics
- Lifetime value (LTV) and cohort analysis
- A/B testing framework for feature experiments
- Market segmentation and player persona analytics

### 4. Real-time Monitoring & Alerting
- Live player activity monitoring
- Performance anomaly detection and alerting
- Revenue and conversion rate monitoring
- Server health and capacity monitoring
- Automated incident response and escalation
