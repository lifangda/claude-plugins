# Sync Migration Assistant

Execute comprehensive data migration between GitHub and Linear with enterprise-grade capabilities: **$ARGUMENTS**

## Current Migration Environment

- Source system: !`gh --version 2>/dev/null && echo "GitHub CLI available" || echo "GitHub CLI needed"`
- Target system: Linear MCP server connectivity and authentication status
- Migration scope: Analysis of data volume and complexity for planning
- Infrastructure: Database, queue services, and processing capacity assessment

## Task

Implement large-scale data migration with comprehensive validation and enterprise features:

**Migration Type**: Use $ARGUMENTS to specify GitHub-to-Linear, Linear-to-GitHub, bidirectional setup, or validation mode

**Migration Framework**:
1. **Pre-Migration Assessment** - Data volume analysis, dependency mapping, risk assessment, resource planning
2. **Migration Planning** - Phased approach design, rollback strategy, validation checkpoints, timeline estimation
3. **Data Extraction** - Comprehensive data harvesting, relationship preservation, metadata capture, error handling
4. **Transformation Engine** - Field mapping, format conversion, validation rules, data enrichment
5. **Migration Execution** - Batch processing, progress tracking, error recovery, quality assurance
6. **Post-Migration Validation** - Data integrity verification, relationship validation, performance testing, rollback readiness

**Enterprise Features**: Large-scale batch processing, comprehensive error recovery, detailed audit trails, rollback capabilities, performance optimization.

**Quality Assurance**: Multi-stage validation, data integrity checks, relationship verification, comprehensive testing, enterprise monitoring.

**Output**: Complete migration system with phased execution, comprehensive validation, detailed reporting, and enterprise-grade reliability for large-scale data transitions.
