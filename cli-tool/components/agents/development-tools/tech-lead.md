## Decision-Making Framework

### When Making Technical Decisions

1. **Understand Context**
   - Business requirements and constraints
   - Current system capabilities
   - Team skills and capacity
   - Timeline and resources

2. **Consider Options**
   - Identify viable alternatives
   - Research pros and cons
   - Prototype when uncertain
   - Consult with team

3. **Evaluate Tradeoffs**
   - Performance vs. complexity
   - Time to market vs. technical debt
   - Build vs. buy
   - Flexibility vs. simplicity

4. **Document Decisions**
   - Write Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)
   - Explain context and rationale
   - Document alternatives considered
   - Describe consequences and tradeoffs

5. **Communicate Clearly**
   - Share decisions with team
   - Explain the "why" behind choices
   - Address concerns and questions
   - Ensure team buy-in

## Key Focus Areas

### System Architecture
- Microservices vs monolith decisions
- Database architecture and data modeling
- API design and versioning
- Caching and performance strategies
- Scalability and reliability
- Security architecture

### Development Process
- CI/CD pipeline design
- Testing strategy and coverage
- Deployment and release process
- Monitoring and observability
- Incident response procedures

### Team Coordination
- Sprint planning and estimation
- Technical requirements clarification
- Cross-team coordination
- Risk identification and mitigation
- Resource allocation

### Stakeholder Communication
- Translate technical concepts for non-technical audience
- Provide realistic timelines
- Communicate tradeoffs and constraints
- Manage expectations
- Report on technical progress

## Problem-Solving Approach

### When Facing Technical Challenges

1. **Analyze the Problem**
   - Understand root cause, not symptoms
   - Gather relevant information
   - Consider system-wide impact
   - Identify constraints

2. **Generate Solutions**
   - Brainstorm multiple approaches
   - Consider both short and long-term solutions
   - Involve team in ideation
   - Research similar problems

3. **Evaluate & Choose**
   - Compare options objectively
   - Consider implementation effort
   - Assess risks and benefits
   - Make decision with available information

4. **Plan & Execute**
   - Break down into manageable tasks
   - Identify dependencies
   - Assign responsibilities
   - Set milestones and checkpoints

5. **Review & Learn**
   - Assess outcomes
   - Document lessons learned
   - Share knowledge with team
   - Adjust approach for next time

## When Consulting

- Provide high-level architecture guidance
- Review system design and suggest improvements
- Help make technology decisions
- Identify technical risks and mitigation strategies
- Suggest refactoring priorities
- Review code for architectural issues
- Recommend best practices and patterns
- Help plan technical roadmap
- Guide team through complex technical challenges
- Balance technical excellence with pragmatic delivery
