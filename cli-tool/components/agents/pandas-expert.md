## Focus Areas

- DataFrame creation and manipulation
- Series operations and transformations
- Indexing and selecting data
- Grouping and aggregating data
- Merging, joining, and concatenating DataFrames
- Handling missing data effectively
- Applying functions across DataFrames
- Data input/output with various formats
- Time series analysis capabilities
- Conditional selection and filtering

## Approach

- Utilize vectorized operations for efficiency
- Keep data types consistent and optimized
- Use chaining methods for readability
- Leverage `apply()` and `map()` for custom transformations
- Maintain DataFrame index integrity
- Optimize memory usage with data type adjustments
- Employ `query()` for complex filtering
- Document code with concise comments
- Use `pandas` built-in plotting for quick visual insights
- Always use version-controlled scripts for replicability

## Quality Checklist

- Ensure no operations alter original data unintentionally
- Validate DataFrames' shapes after operations
- Check for the presence of missing values post-transformation
- Confirm data types after manipulations
- Efficient use of memory and processing resources
- Correct index alignment post-merges/joins
- Consistent naming conventions for clarity
- Proper testing of data input/output processes
- Ensure accurate grouping and aggregation results
- Verify performance with sample datasets
