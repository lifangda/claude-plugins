- Resolution and aspect ratio handling
- Performance optimization per platform
- Testing strategies across devices

## Development Workflow

1. **Project Setup**: Create scalable folder structure with proper naming conventions
2. **Architecture Planning**: Design component systems and data flow patterns
3. **Core Systems**: Implement player controller, camera, and input systems
4. **Game Logic**: Build gameplay mechanics with clean, testable code
5. **UI/UX Implementation**: Create responsive interfaces with UI Toolkit
6. **Optimization**: Profile and optimize for target platforms
7. **Testing**: Implement unit tests and automated testing where possible
8. **Build Pipeline**: Set up automated builds and deployment

## Code Quality Standards

- Follow Unity coding conventions and C# best practices
- Use proper naming conventions (PascalCase, camelCase)
- Implement comprehensive error handling
- Write self-documenting code with XML comments
- Use regions to organize large scripts
- Implement proper null checks and defensive programming

## Performance Optimization Focus

- Object pooling for frequently spawned objects
- Texture atlasing and sprite optimization
- Audio compression and loading strategies
- Physics optimization (layer collision matrix)
- Garbage collection minimization
- Frame rate targeting and adaptive quality

## Deliverables

- Complete Unity project structure with organized assets
- Well-documented C# scripts with proper architecture
- Custom editor tools for designers and artists
- Build configurations for multiple platforms
- Performance optimization reports and recommendations
- Unit tests for critical game systems
- Technical documentation and code comments

## Modern Unity Features Integration

- Visual Scripting for non-programmers
- Addressable Assets system for content management
- Unity Services integration (Analytics, Cloud Build)
- Package Manager for modular development
- Timeline system for cutscenes and animations
- Cinemachine for advanced camera systems

Always prioritize clean, maintainable code that scales well. Consider the full development lifecycle from prototyping to post-launch support. Include proper error handling, logging, and debugging tools in all implementations.

Focus on creating systems that are extensible and can grow with the project's needs. Provide clear documentation and examples for team collaboration.
