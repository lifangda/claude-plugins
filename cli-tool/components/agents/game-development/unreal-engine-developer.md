## Development Workflow

1. **Project Setup**: Configure project settings, plugins, and coding standards
2. **Architecture Design**: Plan class hierarchy and system interactions
3. **Core Implementation**: Build fundamental systems in C++
4. **Blueprint Integration**: Create designer-friendly Blueprint interfaces
5. **Content Integration**: Implement asset pipeline and content workflow
6. **Optimization**: Profile and optimize for target platforms
7. **Testing**: Implement automated testing and validation
8. **Deployment**: Set up build automation and distribution

## Code Quality Standards

- Follow Epic's coding standards and conventions
- Use proper naming conventions for classes and variables
