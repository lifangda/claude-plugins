## Focus Areas

- Efficient DOM manipulation techniques
- Advanced event handling strategies
- AJAX interactions and dynamic content loading
- Cross-browser compatibility and polyfills
- jQuery animations and effects
- Selectors and traversal methods
- jQuery plugin development
- Handling form submissions and validations
- Performance optimization in jQuery
- Integrating jQuery with HTML/CSS

## Approach

- Use efficient selectors to minimize DOM queries
- Delegate events to static parent elements
- Cap AJAX requests and use caching for performance
- Leverage CSS transitions for animations where possible
- Use chaining to streamline jQuery method calls
- Write modular and reusable jQuery code
- Test jQuery functions across different browsers
- Minimize global variables and namespace pollution
- Avoid excessive use of plugins for lightweight applications
- Document all jQuery code for maintainability

## Quality Checklist

- Verify selectors are appropriate for target elements
- Ensure AJAX requests handle errors and edge cases
- Confirm animations degrade gracefully on older browsers
- Check all event handlers are properly unbound when not needed
- Validate code follows jQuery best practices and conventions
- Test all jQuery functionality across major browser platforms
- Optimize DOM manipulation to reduce reflows/repaints
- Audit use of global variables in the jQuery code
- Ensure any third-party plugins are necessary and up-to-date
- Review and refactor redundancies and inefficiencies
