# Commands

Custom slash commands that automate development workflows. Browse and install from **[github.com/lifangda/claude-plugins](https://github.com/lifangda/claude-plugins)**.

## ‚ö° What are Commands?

Commands are custom slash commands for Claude Code that automate common development tasks. Type `/command-name` in Claude Code to execute them.

## Installation

### üì¶ Basic Installation
Install this component locally in your project. Works with your existing Claude Code setup.

```bash
npx claude-plugins@latest --command testing/generate-tests --yes
```

### Multiple Commands
```bash
npx claude-plugins@latest --command setup/setup-testing,performance/optimize-bundle --yes
```

## üí° Usage After Installation

Once installed, use commands in Claude Code:
```
/generate-tests
/optimize-bundle
/security-audit
/setup-testing
```

## üìÅ Command Categories

Browse commands by workflow area to find the right automation for your needs:

### Setup & Configuration
Project initialization and foundation setup. Examples: `setup-ci-cd-pipeline` for automated builds, `setup-testing` for test frameworks, `migrate-to-typescript` for type safety.

### Testing
Test automation and quality assurance workflows. Examples: `generate-tests` for automatic test creation, `setup-e2e` for end-to-end testing, `test-coverage` for coverage analysis.

### Performance
Optimization and performance analysis tools. Examples: `optimize-bundle` for build optimization, `performance-audit` for speed analysis, `add-caching` for performance improvements.

### Database
Database operations and management automation. Examples: `supabase-migration-assistant` for schema changes, `supabase-security-audit` for database security, `supabase-type-generator` for TypeScript types.

### Documentation
Documentation generation and maintenance tools. Examples: `generate-api-docs` for API documentation, `update-readme` for project documentation, `create-guide` for user guides.

### Security
Security analysis and hardening automation. Examples: `security-audit` for vulnerability scanning, `dependency-audit` for package security, `fix-vulnerabilities` for security patches.

## üéØ How to Choose Commands

Select commands based on your current workflow needs:

### By Development Phase
- **Project Start**: Begin with `setup/*` commands for foundation setup
- **Development**: Use `testing/*` and `documentation/*` for quality workflows
- **Pre-launch**: Add `security/*` and `performance/*` for optimization
- **Maintenance**: Focus on `database/*` and `performance/*` for ongoing operations

### By Technology Stack
- **Supabase projects**: Choose `database/supabase-*` commands for database management
- **React applications**: Use `performance/optimize-bundle` for build optimization
- **API projects**: Select `documentation/generate-api-docs` for API documentation
- **Any project**: Start with `setup/setup-testing` for quality foundation

### By Current Challenges
- **Slow builds**: Use `performance/optimize-bundle` for build optimization
- **Missing tests**: Choose `testing/generate-tests` for test automation
- **Security concerns**: Select `security/security-audit` for vulnerability assessment
- **Poor documentation**: Pick `documentation/update-readme` for documentation improvements

## üîß Pro Tips

- **Install setup commands first** for new projects
- **Use testing commands early** in development
- **Add security commands** before deployment
- **Browse [github.com/lifangda/claude-plugins](https://github.com/lifangda/claude-plugins)** for specific workflows
