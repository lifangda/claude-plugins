# MCPs (Model Context Protocol)

External service integrations that extend Claude Code with real-time data access. Browse and install from **[github.com/lifangda/claude-plugins](https://github.com/lifangda/claude-plugins)**.

## üîå What are MCPs?

MCPs connect Claude Code to external services, databases, and APIs. They provide real-time access to live data and services during conversations.

## Installation

### üì¶ Basic Installation
Install this component locally in your project. Works with your existing Claude Code setup.

```bash
npx claude-plugins@latest --mcp database/supabase --yes
```

### Multiple MCPs
```bash
npx claude-plugins@latest --mcp database/supabase,development/github-integration --yes
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

Most MCPs require configuration after installation:

### API Keys
Add required API keys to environment variables:
```bash
# Database MCPs
DATABASE_URL=your_database_url
SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_anon_key

# GitHub MCP
GITHUB_TOKEN=your_github_token

# Cloud MCPs
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_aws_key
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_aws_secret
```

## üí° Usage After Installation

MCPs provide real-time data access:
- **Query databases** directly in conversations
- **Access GitHub repos** and issues
- **Browse documentation** with context
- **Control browsers** for testing
- **Interact with cloud services**

## üìÅ MCP Categories
