"weave https://example.com/article"
"help me plan https://example.com/paper.pdf"
"make this actionable https://blog.com/post"
```

**All these phrases work**: tapestry, weave, help me plan, extract and plan, make this actionable

The skill will:
1. Detect content type (YouTube/article/PDF)

3. Create a Ship-Learn-Next action plan automatically
4. Save both files
5. Ask: "When will you ship Rep 1?"

6. Clean up temporary files

### Article Extractor

```
"Extract the article from https://example.com/blog-post"
"Download this article without the ads"
```

The skill will:
1. Check for extraction tools (reader or trafilatura)
2. Download and extract clean article content
3. Remove ads, navigation, and clutter
4. Save as plain text with article title as filename
5. Show preview of extracted content

### Ship-Learn-Next Action Planner

```

The skill will:
1. Read the content file
2. Extract actionable lessons
3. Help you define a specific quest
4. Design 5 progressive reps (iterations)
5. Save the complete plan as a markdown file

## Philosophy

These skills are built on the principle that **learning = doing better, not knowing more**.

### Ship-Learn-Next Framework
- **Ship**: Create something real (code, content, product)
- **Learn**: Honest reflection on what happened
- **Next**: Plan the next iteration based on learnings

100 reps beats 100 hours of study.
